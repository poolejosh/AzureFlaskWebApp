To get started, install python 3.7+ if not already installed. Then initialize a virtual python environment and activate it:

```bash
$ py -3 -m venv env
$ env\scripts\activate
```

Next, install required dependencies:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can simply run the webapp locally with:

```bash
py src/app.py
```
